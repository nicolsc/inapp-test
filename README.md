#iOS inapp purchase testing


##Description
Just a basic Joshfire Factory app, with two buttons to trigger in app purchases action : purchase & restore

##Status
Need to be tested with an app set up on iTunes Connect + Sandbox test account
Currently, the buttons are here.. and the calls are made to apple platform. But are rejected as expected

##Based on usmart example
